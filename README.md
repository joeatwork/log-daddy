# Log-Daddy is a terrible container

Sometimes you need a container that crashes, refuses to shut down, or
otherwise causes problems. Maybe you're testing one of the many fine
container orchestration tools out there, or maybe you're just into
that sort of thing. Either way, log-daddy won't judge!

## To use

Just pull your container from `quay.io/joeatwork/log-daddy:latest`

## To build

Run the `build` script in the root of the repo. You'll probably want to change the
repository you use to tag the container, unless you're me.
